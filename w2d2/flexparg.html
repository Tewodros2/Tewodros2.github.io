            <h3> Introduction</h3>
            This workshop will focus on the IT services available to support our research communities,
            with an emphasis on
            managing the data challenge we all face. The world of today’s interdisciplinary research—heavily influenced
            by
            the data explosion generated by the Internet, along with the rapid pace of technological advances—requires a
            portfolio of high-quality, 24/7 services that flexible, affordable, reliable and safe.<a

            <h3> The Service</h3>
            Collaboration needs to be at the core of these services to allow researchers to focus on their work while IT
            professionals focus on the technology tools that can illuminate their next discovery. This workshop will
            address
            high-performance computing, bioinformatics, storage/archiving, data management, and more.
