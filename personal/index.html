    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
    <p>
        Born raised in <b>Korem, Tigray</b>. On August 2009, I graduated in Bachelor of Accounting, and I joined <b>Sur
            Construction</b>, a well-recognized company in the country, When I work for sur construction as a senior
        account, I
        have learned different application software. Although my field of study is Accounting, I have a passion for
        technology. I had to use different business intelligence tools to solve different business problems Such as,
        Structural Query Language (SQL), Peach Tree Accounting and Solomon Dynamic.

        With that experience, both my recognition of the importance of software and a burning interest to study and be
        able to develop them grew in me. Soon after that, I won a lottery visa to be admitted to the US, called
        Diversity Visa (DV).With a dream for success and a thirst for more education, I traveled 8,500 miles to the land
        of opportunities, <b>USA</b>. I currently reside in <b>Portland, OR</b>. So far, while working at a family’s
        business as an
        account, I have been studying business opportunities. I also have been volunteering for our community’s church,
        doing bookkeeping. Now I’m MSD student at <a href="https://www.miu.edu/">MIU</a>.
